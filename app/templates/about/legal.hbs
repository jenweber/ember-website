  <h2>Non-Legalese TL;DR</h2>
  <p>
    Ember's strong brand and identity are an important part of the project. We're protective of it! Please be respectful
    and <a href="mailto:leah@emberjs.com">reach out</a> if you're unsure if your use is acceptable. Visit the 
    <LinkTo @route="logos">branding page</LinkTo>
    to learn more about what is and
    isn't permitted, and to download logos.
  </p>

  <p>
    We often grant licenses for use of the Ember logo for non-commercial community use cases. If you think you might be
    one of them, let's talk. We always aim to be reasonable.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Tomster in particular has many more restrictions and should not be used without express authorization. You can
