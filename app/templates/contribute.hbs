    <h2>Participate in an RFC</h2>
    <p>
        RFC stands for Request for Comments, the process that Ember follows to get community input on proposed features. 
        All Ember users are invited to comment on RFCs with their thoughts and opinions,
        as well as write RFCs of their own!
        Once an RFC is merged, that means it has been given the green flag for the feature
        to be built and shipped. That process could take months or years after an RFC is merged.
    </p>

    <h2>Many other ways to contribute</h2>
    <p>
        Contributing isn't just about making commits.
        Helping other people with questions, writing a blog post,
        giving a meetup talk, announcing something
        you built, even sharing some words of encouragement for other creators &mdash;
        these are all ways to help support Open Source and your
        fellow developers.
