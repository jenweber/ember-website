    </p>
    
    <h3>Use the modern JavaScript you know and love</h3>
    <p>
      ES6 classes, fat arrow functions, and even decorators- it's easy to use the latest and greatest in JavaScript features in your app, zero configuration required. Love Typescript? We've got great support for that, too. Tools like Prettier pair perfectly with your Ember app's JavaScript code.

    <h3>Meet Addons: high-quality, curated npm packages that supercharge your app.</h3>
    <p>
      While Ember CLI makes it easy to add any third-party node module, Ember Addons provide capabilities that go beyond your typical npm package.
    </p>
    <p>
      By hooking into Ember CLI's standardized tooling, Ember addons can modify your application's build steps, and help you out with deployment, inline images, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all this power wrapped up into a single install command, and no additional build tool or configuration required, you'll wonder how you could go back to wiring up dependencies on your own ever again.
    </p>

    <h3>Ember Observer, your dependency co-pilot.</h3>
    <p>
      Tired of wondering if your project's next dependency is well-maintained? Have you ever had to make a choice between multiple packagtes with no clear guidance about which one is best? 
    </p>
    <p>
      With Ember Observer, you'll never have to assess the quality of your project's dependencies on your own. Up-to-date rankings make it easy to see an addon's position within the community. Metrics like great documentation, recent releases and automated tests across multiple Ember versions mean you can be confident that your next dependency won't become a liability.
