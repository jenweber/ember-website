  <h2>What is canary?</h2>

  <p>
    "Canary" is whatever code is on the main branch of an Ember project.
    It is unreleased, and is not recommended for production or new learners.
    Often, features in canary are a work-in-progress.
    They may change substantially or be removed before being released,
    and in rare cases, they may never be released.
  </p>

  <p>
    Canary is used in many test suites, so that any bugs in the framework code
    are detected quickly and fixed before a beta is released.
    Some of Ember's key contributors make a habit of working off beta and canary,
    and even use it in production,
    in order to volunteer their efforts as early testers.
